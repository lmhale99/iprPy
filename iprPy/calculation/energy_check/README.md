Idea suggested by Udo v. Toussaint (Max-Planck-Institute f. Plasmaphysics)

## Introduction

The energy_check calculation style provides a quick check if the energy of an atomic configuration matches with an expected one.

### Version notes

- 2/25/2025 : Calculation updated to include more outputs and option to create a dumpfile with atomic forces.

### Additional dependencies

### Disclaimers

- [NIST disclaimers](http://www.nist.gov/public_affairs/disclaimer.cfm)

- Small variations in the energy are to be expected due to numerical precisions.
