## Introduction

The __stacking_fault_map_2D__ calculation style evaluates the full 2D generalized stacking fault map for an array of shifts along a specified crystallographic plane.  A regular grid of points is established and the generalized stacking fault energy is evaluated at each.

### Version notes

- This was previously called the stacking_fault_multi calculation and was renamed for clarity.

### Additional dependencies

### Disclaimers

- [NIST disclaimers](http://www.nist.gov/public_affairs/disclaimer.cfm)
- The system's dimension perpendicular to the fault plane should be large to minimize the interaction of the free surface and the stacking fault.
