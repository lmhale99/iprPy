Introduction
============

The diatom_scan calculation style evaluates the interaction energy
between two atoms at varying distances. This provides a measure of the
isolated pair interaction of two atoms providing insights into the
strengths of the attraction/repulsion and the effective range of
interatomic spacings. This scan also gives insight into the
computational smoothness of the potential’s functional form.
