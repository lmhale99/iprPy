    "This Notebook outlines the code performed by the calc_dislocation_monopole.py calculation and offers a fully self-contained demonstration of the calculation in action.\n",
    "\n",
    "The calculation script constructs a dislocation monopole system.  The Stroh method is used to solve the anisotropic elasticity solution for a perfectly straight dislocation along the z-axis based on the supplied elastic constants, axes orientation, and Burgers vector. A dislocation is then added to a perfect crystal by shifting the atomic positions according to the Stroh displacement. A boundary region in the xy-plane is identified by changing the atom types of atoms based on their positions. Finally, the atoms in the middle of the system are allowed to relax while the boundary region atoms are held fixed.  If a non-zero anneal temperature is specified, then the system is relaxed at that temperature for \n",
